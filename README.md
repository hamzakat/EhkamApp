4. Build the package:
   1. Option 1 (APK): `cd android` then `./gradlew assembleRelease -x bundleReleaseJsAndAssets` it will gives you the release **APK** at `android\app\build\outputs\apk\release` location.
   2. Option 1 (AAB): `cd android` then `./gradlew bundleRelease -x bundleReleaseJsAndAssets` it will gives you the **AAB** file of your project.

### Troubleshooting

4. `cd android` and run `./gradlew clean`
5. If the emulator doesn't work properly: Go to the AVD in the Android Studio and wipe the data of the emulator
6. Reboot the PC
7. Try to build now
